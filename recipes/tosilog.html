        <p>Fried garlic rice with sunny side up eggs and tocino.</p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. uncooked tocino</li>
            <li>3 cups sinigag</li>
            <li>3 sunny side up eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cooking oil</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Sinigag</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups cooked white rice <em>leftover Jasmine rice is preferred</em></li>
            <li>5 cloves crushed garlic</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the water in a cooking pot.</li>
            <li>Once the water starts to boil, pour-in the cooking oil and add the uncooked tocino. Boil in medium heat until the water evaporates.</li>
            <li>Once the water completely evaporate, the oil will be left behind. Let one side of the tocino cook in oil for 3 minutes. Flip the tocino and cook the other side for the same time.</li>
            <li>Arrange the cooked tocino with the eggs in individual plates.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, remove the excess oil in the cooking pot where the tocino was cooked. Heat the same pot and put-in the sinangag. Cook the fried rice for 1 minute while tossing. The residue from the tocino will stick to the fried rice making it more tasty.</li>
            <li>Arrange the fried rice with the tocino in individual plates.</li>
            <li>Serve with spiced vinegar.</li>
            <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

        <p> For the Sinigag</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the cooking oil in a wide pan.</li>
            <li>While the cooking oil is being heated, add the crushed garlic. Note: make sure that the oil is not hot when you add the garlic. Let the garlic slowly cook while the oil gets heated until it becomes golden brown and crisp.</li>
            <li>Add-in the rice; gently stir to distribute the ingredients. Continue to cook for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the salt over the rice and continue to mix all the ingredients gently. Cook for another 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a serving plate.</li>
        </ol>
